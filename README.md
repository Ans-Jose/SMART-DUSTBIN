#  Smart Dustbin Project  

This is a simple **Smart Dustbin** project that uses sensors to detect movement and automatically open the lid.  
It helps promote hygiene by enabling **touchless waste disposal**.  

##  Features
- Automatic lid opening when someone comes near.  
- Uses **ultrasonic sensor** to detect distance.  
- Powered by Arduino / microcontroller.  
- Hygienic and easy to use.  

##  Components Used
- Arduino Uno / Microcontroller  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Servo Motor  
- Dustbin container  
- Jumper wires and Power supply  

##  How It Works
1. The **ultrasonic sensor** detects when a personâ€™s hand is close.  
2. The Arduino receives the signal and activates the **servo motor**.  
3. The servo motor opens the dustbin lid automatically.  
4. After a few seconds, the lid closes again.  

##  Applications
- Public places for better hygiene.  
- Hospitals, schools, and offices.  
- Smart homes and clean environment projects.
